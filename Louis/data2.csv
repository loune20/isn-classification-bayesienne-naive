They look good and stick good! I just don't like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just won't buy a product like this again,4.0,Looks Good

"Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal, it would've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.",4.0,Cute!

it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20%. it is a waste of money.,1.0,not a good Idea
"Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm. I'm glad that it lasts from start to end. 5/5",5.0,Solid Case
"This is a fantastic case. Very stylish and protects my phone. Easy access to all buttons and features, without any loss of phone reception. But most importantly, it double power, just as promised. Great buy",5.0,Perfect Case
this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I can't complain! a+ recommend it to all,5.0,Just what I needed
"This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4. The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn't add much weight to the Galaxy S4. It doubles the battery life. You can charge either the battery, the phone or both. There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well. Well worth the price.",5.0,A Winner
"Performs exactly as advertised . It's very  sturdily built,and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it's supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience. Don't know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it.",5.0,Absolutely love the case !!
"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0,Best Rechargeable Battery Case on the Market!!!!!!!!!! A++++++++
"Just what I needed. I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons, but I also needed new replacement batteries. Now this isn't the case, since I got both in one. Awesome thanks A+",5.0,Exactly what I needed
"When there is no outlets, or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue! Ordered one for my husband, and myself. Great purchase!!",5.0,5 star phone case
"It works great. Doesn't heat up like crazy like the other ones I got, and cheaper too! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get, thats why I got one for me and my wife. I wonder why its called power bear..",5.0,SUPER DUPER QUALITY!
"Surprisingly, this inexpensive version works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive variety. It has been working for me for months now. No problem. Excellent value.",5.0,Top Quality. Works like the Expensive Version
"I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.",5.0,High power as promised!
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money.,1.0,Horrible
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it.,5.0,USB Port

"does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.",3.0,it works
"They are nothing special for sure, but it's nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it.  able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice.",4.0,I like the fact they light up.
"I have several chargers. Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products.",4.0,Works great
I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review.,5.0,Works great
I am disappointed that the 1A didn't work with my iPad.  That's what I get for buying a cheap adapter.,2.0,This doesn't work with my iPad.
"This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.",4.0,Solid Charger but RF noisy
After a week only one side works,2.0,Two Stars
Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion. And the item is just as described. Great buy if you ask me,4.0,Ok

"I've bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most wouldn't stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT!",5.0,good
"Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables, one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it's the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.",1.0,"don't waste your money, pay more and buy one at Walgreen s."
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone,5.0,charger
"It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job",4.0,good job
Didn't last very long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I shouldn't have expected it to last.,2.0,Works for a while.
"excellent product, works great , have easy handling, and good quality as it is announced. reached as is shown time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything",4.0,good
Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling,5.0,Works great. Very inexpensive
great charger for 2 devices and i haven't had any problems so far 3yrs now,5.0,Five Stars
Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%,4.0,Dual USB Port Car Charger
"I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on.",2.0,not high power
"I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it's cheap, small and compact",5.0,works
Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too.,5.0,USB Outlet
"works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger.",4.0,Good little charger
"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design very handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I'll never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I haven't found one in my price range yet.",2.0,"Works Fine, But It Died On ME"
"This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great value and easy on the wallet.",5.0,Great Dual Charger
"I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system",1.0,Be careful
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go!,5.0,A must have for people on the go
"I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once!  Seems to charge quicker without GPS on, with it on, it only holds the battery, but better than it dying!!!",4.0,Works best without location/GPS on device
Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port.  Works.,4.0,Works
I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price,4.0,Pretty good
"I have several of these, from various retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They're great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn't expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don't last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.",5.0,"Great DC Charger, Works Great, $2 Value"
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer,5.0,good product at low price
"I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a very good deal.",4.0,Works as advertised
I love this case! It's so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy!,5.0,I recommend
The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.,3.0,Nice
"I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The ""rubberized"" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!",5.0,Perfect!
Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks,5.0,Pretty
"The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.",4.0,Not what I expected.
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!,4.0,Worth the price
This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend,5.0,Great
"Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a ""good look"" for their phone.",5.0,better than expected!
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,4.0,htc evo cover
"I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.",2.0,Loved it at first
"The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.",4.0,Cute
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.,5.0,Simple and Attractive Protector
The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent.,4.0,Good Case
This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,4.0,This case is exactly as described
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot.,5.0,Love it!
It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again,2.0,Don't waste your money!
"This case for some reason is peeling, there isn't much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i wouldn't recommend this specific one for anyone.",1.0,bad experience
Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.,5.0,Love it
"Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.",5.0,good deal
This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone.  It is very stylish and I received many compliments,5.0,stylish!
"This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!!",5.0,SOOO CUTE AND AFFORDABLE!
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,5.0,plastic with suede

Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger.,5.0,Great charger and great price
"Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.",5.0,Great multipurpose charger!
"I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries.",5.0,Holds up over time
"so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.",5.0,Working fine
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,4.0,GOOD BUY
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it.,4.0,Very good charger.
Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2.,5.0,Travel charger.
"I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I don't have to struggle to see my phone when I'm laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter doesn't like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this!",4.0,"Buy this if you want a good, long charger"
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.,5.0,Very Good!
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I've been thru several!!!!,1.0,Poor Quality Cell Phone Charger
"This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!",5.0,Galaxy S4 Charger
I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4.,5.0,Backup  for work
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,5.0,Works Great...
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!,5.0,CAME RIGHT IN HANDY!
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it.,4.0,buy it if you need a car charger
"I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!).",5.0,OEM Samsung micro USB charger

It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail,3.0,this is great buy and very useful
"The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.",5.0,It Works Great
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot.,4.0,Very fast charging.
